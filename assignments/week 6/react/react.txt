React
    - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
        - Lightweight
            - meant to be used with other modules of the user's choice (ie: React Router)
        - React DOM, React Native, React VR
    - Declarative
        - using React, we describe the desired state using JSX
            - React handles the rest
    - Not a framework
        - Technically, React is a library and not a framework
        - Frameworks (like Vue, Angular) have their "right" way of doing things
            - "forced" to do things the way they want/use their dependencies
            - Frameworks generally "call your code"
    - Component based architecture
        - breaking down a ui into smaller reusable components
            - inject/remove views and functionality of the same page rather than requesting a new one
        - Single Page Application
            - Design Pattern
            - no longer need to fully reload the web page with another view (ONLY ONE VIEW)
            - web pack
                - static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications
    - Virtual DOM
        - used to render elements more efficiently than traditional DOM manipulation
        - keeps virtual views in memory
            - updates/changes made are compared to the virual dom representation in memory
            - the differential is calculated - Reconciliation
            - only the necessary changes are made to the DOM
